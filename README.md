This project is an extensible modular C++ application for trajectory computation. It supports both kinematic and kinodynamic environments, as well as the astrodynamic environment, representing the dynamics of the Solar System.

The application consists of two parts - C++ planner, which does all the heavy lifting and Python scripts for data processing, visualization and testing. The dependencies for the Python scripts are provided in requirements.txt.
The C++ component depends on a number of third-party libraries, namely spdlog, rapid, ompl, mpnn, boost, fbx_sdk, jsoncpp, eigen and gtest.
