# PathSimTools

PathSimTools is a Python-based utility designed to enhance the workflow of the `PathPlanning3D` project. It serves as an interface for integrating Blender with the C++ path planning program, enabling visualization of simulation results and creation of environments for testing.

## Features

- **Environment Creation**: Build dynamic or static environments for path planning simulations.
- **Visualization**: Replay and visualize the output of the C++ program in Blender.
- **Integration**: Automate the process of parameter generation, simulation execution, and result visualization.
- **Flexible Workflow**: Combine Blender's modeling capabilities with the computational power of the C++ path planning program.
